Initializing...
# dc-template.tcl script 
#
# 2017/02/14  Reduced output_delay to 4% and input_delay to 3% of the clock 
#             cycle time so very short critical paths are visible in timing 
#             reports. Also changed clock_skew from 250ps to 5% of cycle time 
#             so it will scale with clock frequency.
# 2017/02/10  Uncommented "analyze -format verilog ./proc.v" line. It seems to
#             be needed only the first time synthesis is run.
# 2017/02/04  Changes for NanGate 45 nm library including new timing parameters
# 2012/02/22  Changed:
#               ungroup -all -flatten -simple_names
#             to:
#               if { [sizeof_collection [get_cells * -filter 
#                  "is_hierarchical==true"]] > 0 } {
#                  ungroup -all -flatten -simple_names
#                  }
# 2010/02/16  Updated commented path to vtvtlib25.db
# 2009/02/12  Many parts re-written in new tcl version by Zhibin Xiao
# 2006/01/30  Updated /afs/.../vtvtlib25.db path to this quarter's path.
# 2004/02/05  Updated /afs/.../vtvtlib25.db path to this quarter's path.
# 2003/05/22  Increased input_setup from 500 to 6000 (external input delay
#             now 6ns instead of 9.5ns) so input paths don't show up at the
#             top of timing reports so often.
